Finding Shortest path of a clustered vertex graph
// I will use the terms vertex and node interchangeably
// Link, edge, relationship are also used interchangeably 
What is a “clustered vertex” graph: a graph that have a sparse adjacency matrix, and most of the vertices are connected to few “hub” nodes and the hubs
For example, given the illustrated graph G = (V, E)
